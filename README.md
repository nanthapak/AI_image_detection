# AI Generated Picture Recognition Project  

In present world, AI generated image are all over the place. How do you going to know if that image are real or not. this question trigger me to create a project to recognize ai generated picture.  
I'm using data from the researched dataset called CIFAKE-dataset which contain 60,000 real images and 60,000 fake images. The reason i choose this dataset because it's very lightweight pixellixe picture which is suitable for the pattern recognize of deep learning algorithm like CNN.
